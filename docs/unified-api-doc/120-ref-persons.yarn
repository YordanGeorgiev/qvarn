### Tests

We create a new person, update them, and delete them.

    SCENARIO manage a person

Client has needed access rights for persons resource.

    GIVEN client has access to scopes
    ... "uapi_persons_post uapi_persons_get uapi_persons_id_get
    ...  uapi_persons_id_private_get uapi_persons_id_put
    ...  uapi_persons_id_private_put uapi_persons_id_delete
    ...  uapi_persons_id_photo_get uapi_persons_id_photo_put"

Try to create a new person, but with invalid data. These must all
fail, of course. First, an empty record:

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with {}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

Only specific fields are allowed. The API does not accept arbitrary
data from the client.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with {"invalid_field": true}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

The only mandatory field is `names`, but it can't be empty.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with {"names": []}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

The name must be specified in structured form, not just as a string.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with {"names": ["James Bond"]}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

The full name must be given.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with
    ... {"names": [{"given_names": ["James"], "surnames": ["Bond"]}]}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

The full name must not be empty.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with {"names": [{"full_name": ""}]}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

Extra fields for a name are not allowed.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with
    ... {"names": [{"full_name": "James Bond", "nickname": "Jimbo"}]}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

Create a new person. Note that even if we only submit the mandatory
fields, we get a result with all optional fields filled in with empty
values.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with
    ... {
    ...     "names": [
    ...         {
    ...             "full_name": "James Bond",
    ...             "sort_key": "Bond, James",
    ...             "titles": ["Mr"],
    ...             "given_names": ["James"],
    ...             "surnames": ["Bond"]
    ...         },
    ...         {
    ...             "full_name": "Alfred E. Newman"
    ...         }
    ...     ]
    ... }
    THEN HTTP status code is 201
    AND result matches
    ... {
    ...     "names": [
    ...         {
    ...             "full_name": "James Bond",
    ...             "sort_key": "Bond, James",
    ...             "titles": ["Mr"],
    ...             "given_names": ["James"],
    ...             "surnames": ["Bond"]
    ...         },
    ...         {
    ...             "full_name": "Alfred E. Newman"
    ...         }
    ...     ]
    ... }
    AND result has key "id" containing a string, saved as $ID1
    AND HTTP Location header is API_URL/persons/$ID1
    AND result has key "revision" containing a string, saved as $REV1

Check that the record is there.

    WHEN client GETs /persons
    THEN HTTP status code is 200
    AND result has key "resources", a list containing { "id": "$ID1" }

    WHEN client GETs /persons/$ID1
    THEN HTTP status code is 200
    AND result matches
    ... {
    ...     "names": [
    ...         {
    ...             "full_name": "James Bond",
    ...             "sort_key": "Bond, James",
    ...             "titles": ["Mr"],
    ...             "given_names": ["James"],
    ...             "surnames": ["Bond"]
    ...         },
    ...         {
    ...             "full_name": "Alfred E. Newman",
    ...             "sort_key": "",
    ...             "titles": [],
    ...             "given_names": [],
    ...             "surnames": []
    ...         }
    ...     ]
    ... }
    AND result has key "id" containing a string, saved as $ID2
    AND values "$ID1" and "$ID2" are identical
    AND result has key "revision" containing a string, saved as $REV2
    AND values "$REV1" and "$REV2" are identical

The private sub-record should also be there, without being added
explicitly, even if it has no data.

    WHEN client GETs /persons/$ID1/private
    THEN HTTP status code is 200

Update the record.

    WHEN client PUTs /persons/$ID1 with
    ... {
    ...     "revision": "$REV1",
    ...     "names": [{"full_name": "M"}]
    ... }
    THEN HTTP status code is 200
    AND result matches { "names": [{"full_name": "M"}]}
    AND result has key "id" containing a string, saved as $ID3
    AND values "$ID1" and "$ID3" are identical
    AND result has key "revision" containing a string, saved as $REV3

Updating with the wrong revision should fail.

    WHEN client PUTs /persons/$ID1 with
    ... {
    ...     "revision": "$REV1",
    ...     "names": [{"full_name": "Blofeld"}]
    ... }
    THEN HTTP status code is 409
    WHEN client GETs /persons/$ID1
    THEN result matches
    ... {
    ...     "revision": "$REV3",
    ...     "names": [{"full_name": "M"}]
    ... }


Update the private sub-record. Note that we give the revision of the
main record.

    WHEN client PUTs /persons/$ID1/private with
    ... {
    ...     "revision": "$REV3",
    ...     "date_of_birth": "1920-11-11"
    ... }
    THEN HTTP status code is 200
    AND result matches { "date_of_birth": "1920-11-11" }
    AND result has key "revision" containing a string, saved as $REV4

(Not bothering to check that all the fields are set. Let's assume they
are, to keep the test a bit shorter.)

Updating the sub-record without the correct revision should fail.

    WHEN client PUTs /persons/$ID1/private with
    ... {
    ...     "revision": "this-is-the-wrong-revision",
    ...     "date_of_birth": "1920-11-11"
    ... }
    THEN HTTP status code is 409

Can not get unsent photo.

    WHEN client GETs /persons/$ID1/photo
    THEN HTTP status code is 404

Send photo.

    GIVEN file test.png containing "This pretends to be a png"

    WHEN client PUTs file test.png with content type image/png
    ...  and revision $REV4 to /persons/$ID1/photo
    THEN HTTP status code is 200

    WHEN client GETs /persons/$ID1/photo
    THEN HTTP status code is 200
    AND HTTP header Content-Type is image/png
    AND HTTP header Revision exists
    AND result body matches file test.png

Can not send photo with no Content-Length header set.

    WHEN client POSTs /persons with
    ... {"names": [{"full_name": "James Bond"},
    ...            {"full_name": "Alfred E. Newman"}]}
    THEN result has key "id" containing a string, saved as $ID4
    AND result has key "revision" containing a string, saved as $REV5

Without request body (no Content-Length header) server responds with status
Length Required 411.

    WHEN client PUTs no file with content type image/png
    ...  and revision $REV5 to /persons/$ID4/photo
    THEN HTTP status code is 411

Delete the record.

    WHEN client DELETEs /persons/$ID1
    THEN HTTP status code is 200

    WHEN client GETs /persons/$ID1
    THEN HTTP status code is 404

The private sub-record should be gone too.

    WHEN client GETs /persons/$ID1/private
    THEN HTTP status code is 404
