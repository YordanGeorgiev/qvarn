### Tests

We create a new competence, update them, and delete them.

    SCENARIO manage a competence

Client has needed access rights for competence resource.

    GIVEN client has access to scopes
    ... "uapi_competences_post uapi_competences_get uapi_competences_id_get
    ...  uapi_competences_id_put uapi_competences_id_delete"

Try to create a new competence. Test with an invalid field.

    WHEN client POSTs /competences with {"invalid_field": true}
    THEN HTTP status code is 400

Create a new competence.

    WHEN client POSTs /competences with

    AND result has key "id" containing a string, saved as $ID1
    AND HTTP Location header is API_URL/competences/$ID1

Check that the record is there.

    WHEN client GETs /competences

    AND values "$ID1" and "$ID2" are identical
    AND result has key "revision" containing a string, saved as $REV2
    AND values "$REV1" and "$REV2" are identical

Update the record.

    WHEN client PUTs /competences/$ID1 with
    ... {
    ...     "revision": "$REV1",
    ...     "valid_from_date": "2015-05-09"

    AND result has key "id" containing a string, saved as $ID3
    AND values "$ID1" and "$ID3" are identical
    AND result has key "revision" containing a string, saved as $REV3

Delete the record.

    WHEN client DELETEs /competences/$ID1
    THEN HTTP status code is 200

    WHEN client GETs /competences/$ID1
    THEN HTTP status code is 404
