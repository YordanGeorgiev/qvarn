# Our own copy of bottle.py. This is not our code, so we do not have
# unit tests for it.

# The database abstraction layer. This is meant to be simple and obvious
# enough that unit tests are not needed.
unifiedapi/db.py

# The backend application main program. This does things like parsing
# the command line or starting the HTTP server. These are things that
# do not benefit much from unit tests, and are better tested by system
# level tests, to avoid having to mock the universe.
unifiedapi/backend_app.py

# Classes for simple ("/version") and list-style ("/persons") resources.
# These don't do enough things that make sense to unit test. These get
# tested properly by system level tests, especially the API test suite.

unifiedapi/simple_resource.py

# This only logs an HTTP request. That's something that it doesn't make a lot
# sense to unit test (it'd just require mocking and verifying that the right
# log function gets called, and that's not worth the effort).
unifiedapi/logging_plugin.py

# Does not contain much logic, logic is mostly separated to AuthValidator and
# util.py
