NEWS for Qvarn
==============

Version 0.71, released 2016-05-26
----------------------------------

* Some source code cleanups have been made to placate the pylint tool.
  This should not be visible to users.

* Put back the `org.is_luotettava_kumppani_member` field, which got
  dropped earlier. A client application is using it and it's faster to
  un-break Qvarn by adding the field than to ask them to fix their
  end. We'll re-remove the field later, at a more opportune moment.

Version 0.70, released 2016-05-25
----------------------------------

* Improve speed of searches by dropping the previous approach
  (COUNT(id) turns out to be slow in Postgres) and using INNER JOIN
  instead. By Ville Niskala.

Version 0.69, released 2016-05-24
----------------------------------

* Attempt to improve the speed of search queries, by Ville Niskala.
  This version attempts to avoid unnecessary queries, and to implement
  an AND between conditions in a more efficient way. However, this
  hasn't been benchmarked yet: this release is to enable benchmarks to
  be run.

Version 0.68, released 2016-05-23
----------------------------------

* No-change release, to trigger a new build. Sorry.

Version 0.67, released 2016-05-23
----------------------------------

* Missing build dependencies added to Debian packaging.

Version 0.66, released 2016-05-23
----------------------------------

* This is the first release with a NEWS file.
